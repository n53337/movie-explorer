## Problem Overview

The task was to build a movie explorer app that interacts with the TMDb API, retrieves movie data, and offers a smooth user experience with:

    ‚Ä¢	Data Fetching using Axios
    ‚Ä¢	Caching and Pagination via TanStack Query V5
    ‚Ä¢	Modal windows for detailed views
    ‚Ä¢	A search feature to explore specific movies.

## Solution Design

### Data Fetching and Caching

I used TanStack Query V5 for its powerful caching capabilities. It reduces unnecessary API calls by caching previously fetched data. I also use custom hooks to make it easier to deal with the data fetching process.

### Pagination

I've implemented pagination using the `useInfiniteQuery` hook from TanStack Query V5. This hook allows you to fetch data in a paginated way. and i use the `Intersection Observer API` to trigger the loading of the next page when the user scrolls to the bottom of the current page.

### Debouncing

I also Debouncing technique to avoid "request spamming", so the user can only make a request every 500ms.

### Performance

I considered performance as a crucial aspect of the app, because it has so many assets (Images) to load, which can slow down the loading time. Espically for low network speeds. So I used the `next/image` component to optimize the image sizes. and the `lazy loading` technique, so that you only fetch images when they are needed.
